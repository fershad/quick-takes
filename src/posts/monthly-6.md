A look back at a very busy June 2024.

## June 2024

🤕 **15 minutes of Touch in HK**. The month began with a quick trip to Hong Kong to play a few warm up games against Hong Kong & Chinese teams in preparation for the 2024 Touch World Cup. We played on a veeeeeeery rainy Hong Kong morning, and I barely lasted 15 minutes into the first half of our first game. I managed to get whacked in the face and ended up getting 4 stitches at a nearby hospital. Still, it was a very fun short little trip to Hong Kong & a good work out for our team.

🥳 **Surprising my for her 70th**. A few days after getting back from Hong Kong, Kay and I went down to Sydney for a week and surprised my mum for her 70th birthday. It was pretty cool, and she was genuinely surprised - both that we were there, and that my dad had also managed to keep it a secret from her. My sister and her fiance also came over for a few days. One of the rare chances we get to be all together as a family now.

📓 **Starting to journal daily**. I picked up a Hobonichi Daily diary towards the end of the month, and plan to use it to start journaling a bit every day. I can't remember where I read it, but I recall seeing someone saying how their daily journaling habit made the passing of the year feel less rushed. Interested to see how it goes over the next 6 months.

### Tracking start, stop, continue targets

These are things [I set out to do more or less of in 2024](https://qt.fershad.com/writing/start-stop-continue-2024/). I'm not big on habit tracking, so this "tracking" report is all just vibes.

#### **Start**

- _Going to the gym regularly:_ 😐 Fallen off a bit with all the comings and goings this month.
- _Doing 20k+ bike rides each week:_ Nope ❎. Want to pick it up in August.
- _Writing monthly reviews:_ Yep ⭐, you're reading it now, and they've now got their own section on this blog too.
- _Taking the cat outside the apartment:_ Nope ❎. Feel sorry for leaving her with all the travel I'm doing this year 😦.
- _Capturing thoughts in a notebook:_ 😐 Starting out this month though.

#### **Stop**

- _Sugary snacks:_ Kinda 😐. I've definitely cut back a little more this month.
- _Using my phone in bed:_ Nope ❎.

#### **Continue**

- _Taking regular breaks/vacations with Kay:_ 😀 We're off on an epic Norway holiday next month! And the Himalayas in September too~~
- _Getting nerd-sniped by work stuff:_ Yes 😀. I _still_ want to make a carbon tracking page for my website.
- _Following other folks on RSS:_ Nope ❎. _Still_ gotta clean up my current feed.
- _Building a financial safety-net:_ Nope 🙁. But I have been taking advantage of the weak Yen to stock up on some cash for future trips there.
