Hey, since May 1st is a public holiday in Taiwan I'm able to write out my monthly on time for change!

## April 2024

💚 **Green IO Conference in Singapore**. I've been a fan of the Green IO podcast since Gael Duez first launched it back in 2022. I'm probably biased there, being his first ever guest. It's been awesome to see the podcast grow, as well as the community that Gael has fostered around it. That community now includes three conferences in London, Paris, and Singapore. I was fortunate enough to attend the Singapore conference this year (the first Green IO conference outside of Europe). It was great to connect with and learn from the community there, which made for a pleasant change from my usual fare of connecting with folks via video call. If you're interested, I wrote a [wrap up of the conference](https://fershad.com/writing/speaking-about-green-it-in-asia-2024/), and shared my slides, on my website.

🏉 **Touch World Cup is getting real**. The Touch World Cup is less than 90-days away now, and beginning to feel very, very real! I can't wait to get over to Nottingham to catch up with friends and play against some of the best players in the World. We've been drawn in a group with New Zealand who are the 2nd ranked Touch nation in the World behind Australia. Our tickets have been booked, but until we get on that plane we're still working on our fitness and gameplay as much as we can here in Taiwan.

Other than those two things, April was a pretty non-eventful month. I was able to get some regular structure back into life and work, which was a nice change after a very hectic February and March.

### Tracking start, stop, continue targets

These are things [I set out to do more or less of in 2024](https://qt.fershad.com/writing/start-stop-continue-2024/). I'm not big on habit tracking, so this "tracking" report is all just vibes.

#### **Start**

- _Going to the gym regularly:_ Back on that horse ✅.
- _Doing 20k+ bike rides each week:_ Nope ❎.
- _Writing monthly reviews:_ Yep ⭐, you're reading it now.
- _Taking the cat outside the apartment:_ Nope ❎.
- _Capturing thoughts in a notebook:_ Nope ❎. I've put it out on my desk at least.

#### **Stop**

- _Sugary snacks:_ Nope ❎. I've cut back, but still work to do here.
- _Using my phone in bed:_ Nope ❎.

#### **Continue**

- _Taking regular breaks/vacations with Kay:_ Nope ❎. But we are going back to Sydney for a brief trip in June.
- _Getting nerd-sniped by work stuff:_ Yes 😀. I've got a backlog of blog posts & coding ideas.
- _Following other folks on RSS:_ Nope ❎. Still gotta clean up my current feed.
- _Building a financial safety-net:_ Nope 🙁. Though starting to feel like this will be possible in the coming months.
