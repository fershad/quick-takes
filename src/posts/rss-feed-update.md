This post is a heads up for those of you who subscribe to the RSS feed for this notes website.

I'm close to completing a website redesign, and am hoping to have it all merged into the main website later this week. As part of that, I've also decided to move the notes from here onto my main site. With this change, I'll be consolidating both my (ir)regular posts and notes into the RSS feed for my main website.

## Actions you can take

If you want to keep receiving my notes in your RSS feed, you can either:

- Subscribe to the main feed at [https://fershad.com/feed.xml](https://fershad.com/feed.xml) to get all the stuff I publish (long form posts, plus notes).
- Subscribe to the new Notes feed at [https://fershad.com/feed-notes.xml](https://fershad.com/feed-notes.xml) to get the short notes, quick thoughts, monthly recaps, and link posts that I'm hoping to publish more of in 2025.

## Sunsetting Quick Takes

This post will also be the last one I make here. All future content will be found on my website at [fershad.com/writing](https://fershad.com/writing).
