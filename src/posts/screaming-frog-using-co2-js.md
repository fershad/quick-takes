Earlier this week, I found out that [the latest version of Screaming Frog](https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider-20/) (the SEO crawling software) is using CO2.js!! The tool scans entire websites and presents really detailed reports and data that can be used for SEO and other optimisation tasks. They've now also included a column for carbon estimates and ratings, based on the Sustainable Web Design Model.

I was absolutely chuffed to hear this, not just from a personal perspective either. Having this information surfaced in Screaming Frog reports puts digital sustainability metrics in front of, and into the hands of, a whole new audience of IT professionals.
