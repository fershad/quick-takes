ðŸŽ‰ Are my third parties green? now has browser extensions for Firefox and Chrome!!

This has been on my to-do list for some time, and I finally got some time earlier this month to create these. The extensions allow Are my third parties green? tests to be run by a user on almost any site, and not just at load time. This means you can:

-   Check third-party requests after interaction (e.g. accepting cookie consent).
-   Check third-party requests for pages that require authentication or have restricted access.
-   Check third-party requests based on your actual location (or using a VPN).
