One thing I wanted to start doing in 2024 was to capture monthly notes of some of the goings on in my life. I've never been good at note taking or journaling, so this is me trying to start it becoming a habit.

The idea takes a lot of inspiration from Dave Rupert's monthly [vibe checks](/Users/fershad/Developer/quick-takes/src/posts/monthly-1.md). Rach Smith has also [started doing something similar](https://rachsmith.com/tags/#mn&n) over on her blog.

## January 2024

üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Back into the gym, and running**. The month started with me recovering from an eye operation that I had in late December. It meant that I wasn't able to play Touch for a few weeks, or do any other exercise. Now that my eye's healed, I've been going to the gym at least twice a week to do strength work. I've also been trying to increase my cardio activity with some running on non-Touch days.

All this work is currently going towards the goal of representing Taiwan at the 2024 Touch World Cup this July. I hope I can keep it up once that event is done though.

üßë‚Äçü¶≤ **My eye's better!** Which is a good thing. My vision was corrected as soon as the operation was over, but it took a solid three weeks before redness & swelling in my eye died down. I haven't experience any double vision, or issues with depth perception since the operation. The other good news is that I no longer have discomfort when using the computer for a long period of time. But the bad news is I no longer have discomfort when using the computer for a long period of time. Need to exercise a bit more self-control there.

üë®‚Äçüíª **Types for CO2.js!** During the month we finally published type definitions for CO2.js through the DefinitelyTyped project. This was something that had been talked about a fair bit in our Github repo, so it was nice to finally get it over the line. We also [released two updates to CO2.js](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/news/release-guide-co2-js-v0-14/) this month.

üë®‚Äçüíª **Thoughts on alternative website carbon calculations.** At the very start of the month I began thinking about possible alternate ways to estimate website carbon emissions. I published a first post, looking at the data center segment which [rejigged the work done by the folks behind Cloud Carbon Footprint](https://fershad.com/writing/adapting-cloud-carbon-footprints-methodology-to-website-carbon-estimates/). This kinda thought experiment stuff is right up my alley, and I've got another post lined up looking at then network & device segments to round off the calculation.

### Tracking start, stop, continue targets

These are things [I set out to do more or less of in 2024](https://qt.fershad.com/writing/start-stop-continue-2024/). I'm not big on habit tracking, so this "tracking" report is all just vibes.

#### **Start**

- _Going to the gym regularly:_ Yep ‚≠ê
- _Doing 20k+ bike rides each week:_ Nope ‚ùé. It's winter, gimme a break. I have been running a bit more instead.
- _Writing monthly reviews:_ Yep ‚≠ê, you're reading it now.
- _Taking the cat outside the apartment:_ Nope ‚ùé
- _Capturing thoughts in a notebook:_ Nope ‚ùé

#### **Stop**

- _Sugary snacks:_ Nope ‚ùé
- _Using my phone in bed:_ Nope ‚ùé

#### **Continue**

- _Taking regular breaks/vacations with Kay:_ Nope ‚ùé. But we are planning a trip to the Nordics this summer after the Touch World Cup!
- _Getting nerd-sniped by work stuff:_ Yep ‚≠ê 1000000%
- _Following other folks on RSS:_ Nope ‚ùé. I have trouble keeping up with my feed as it is. Perhaps it's time to clean it up.
- _Building a financial safety-net:_ Yep ‚≠ê
