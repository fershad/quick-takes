Last week I made a first weekly post title ["The best things I heard this week (Week 19, 2024)"](https://qt.fershad.com/writing/the-best-things-i-heard-this-week/). I've decided to change that up to be broader to include things I've read as well as things I've heard.

## [Manifesto for a Humane Web](https://humanewebmanifesto.com/)

This is amazing from Michelle Barker.

> We need a web by and for humans.

## [【Taiwanology Ep.25】How can Taiwan build more renewable energy?](https://open.firstory.me/story/clw4cif3a001u01wf32xo7pfd)

I already knew there were challenges to deploying renewables here in Taiwan, but learnt a heap about the nuance involved & other challenges facing the energy transition here in this week's Taiwanology podcast.

> So the biggest driver for the Taiwanese companies never was the regulatory system in Taiwan. It was ... the supply chain.

## [Freecodecamp Podcast with ThePrimeagen](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/ai-is-overrated-why-theprimeagen-ripped-out-github-copilot-from-his-code-editor-podcast-124/)

There were some gems in this podcast episode that really resonated with me. The conversation between Quincy Larson and ThePrimeagen in a winding one, venturing down many side lanes along the way.

> Like the, you know, often the answer isn't just simply what you want to know. It's like that act of gathering it, going through things. And yes, it's like way inefficient.

## [Microsoft employees spent years fighting the tech giant’s oil ties. Now, they’re speaking out.](https://grist.org/accountability/microsoft-employees-spent-years-fighting-the-tech-giants-oil-ties-now-theyre-speaking-out/)

A peak behind the curtain of one of the World's largest organisations, and one with some pretty lofty sustainability targets. This story shows another side to the glossy publications and sustainablity reports Microsoft puts out. It's the perspective of those within the organisation (or once within the organisation) who were pushing for a shift in the organisations actions to match their words. Also see this [post from Duncan Austin on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/duncanaustinuk_microsoft-esg-activity-7197550825605349376-rJro) in the light of Microsoft's latest ESG report which shows a 30% increase in GHG emissions compared to their 2020 baseline.

> What’s more, oil companies simply had to put forth a net-zero target. Microsoft wasn’t requiring them to do anything to show they were on track to meet it.
