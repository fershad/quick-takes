A busy month front loading work at the start of September, before spending the rest of the month away in northern India with Kay.

## September 2024

🇳🇴 **India**. I'm Indian by birth. My parents moved the family to Australia when I was 2 years old, and although we went back regularly when I was younger it's been a full 20 years since I last returned to the country. So I was pretty excited by the chance to join Kay in Rishikesh and the surrounding region for a couple of weeks. She was there for some classes with her Pranayama teacher, and then traveling with a group of students and their teacher to four major Hindu temples.

It was a great trip, despite the fact that a landslide prevented us from visiting one of the temples at Kedarnath. India was as chaotic as I remembered, but you could see definite areas where the country has progressed. There's a lot of construction happening in the north eastern regions, especially around the Chinese border. The roads there at the moment are pretty terrible, but I reckon if we returned in 5 years that'd be a different story.

Everyone left the trip with different emotions. Some in the group found it life changing & spiritually moving. For me, there was no spiritual awakening, but it was pretty awesome to get back in touch with a place and culture I've been disconnected from for too long.

India was the highlight of the month, so I'm just going to leave it there for this review.

### Tracking start, stop, continue targets

These are things [I set out to do more or less of in 2024](https://qt.fershad.com/writing/start-stop-continue-2024/). I'm not big on habit tracking, so this "tracking" report is all just vibes.

#### **Start**

- _Going to the gym regularly:_ 😐 Lol, nah. Too much travel.
- _Doing 20k+ bike rides each week:_ Nope ❎. Got the bike back from maintenance when we got back & hopefully the typhoon rains clear next week so I can start riding.
- _Writing monthly reviews:_ Yep ⭐, you're reading it now.
- _Taking the cat outside the apartment:_ Nope ❎.
- _Capturing thoughts in a notebook:_ ⭐ Wrote a daily journal during the India trip.

#### **Stop**

- _Sugary snacks:_ Yep ⭐. I feel that the trip to India helped with this. Now the hard part will be keeping up the discipline back in Taiwan.
- _Using my phone in bed:_ Nope ❎.

#### **Continue**

- _Taking regular breaks/vacations with Kay:_ 😀 We're planning our next trips, but aiming to make them more manageable than the ones we've had this year.
- _Getting nerd-sniped by work stuff:_ Yes 😀. I _still_ want to make a carbon tracking page for my website. Also had a few other ideas during the India trip.
- _Following other folks on RSS:_ Nope ❎. Waaaay behind now. _Still_ gotta clean up my current feed.
- _Building a financial safety-net:_ Nope, but making a plan now that our traveling is out of the way.
