Another late monthly update post. Been a busy couple of weeks, mostly because I was sick as at the beginning of September which pushed a bunch of things back.

## August 2024

🇳🇴 **Norway**. Most of August was spent traveling around Western Norway. We started in Oslo, a nice little city which we wished we had a few more days to explore. After a day in Oslo we set out Bergen in the West, and then North towards Molde. We spent a whole 10 days driving through the fjords, pretty much saying "woooooow!" after each turn.

It was quite an experience - taking ferries between towns, navigating around underground roundabouts, stopping at self-service fruit stalls by the roadside, and doing all that in mostly drizzly rain. While the weather didn't play ball, Norway was amazing.

🔌 **First time driving electric**. We did this trip in Norway in an electric car. This was my first time driving electric, and as a drive man it's soooo good. One thing that took us a bit of time adjusting to was the need to plan charging stops in to our trip & travel times. Towards the end we got the hang of it, but initially our charging stops added unexpected chunks of time to our journeys. Besides that, no real complaints about electric although I'm very aware that Norway is better equipped than other places in this regard.

🇩🇰 **Copenhagen**. After Norway, we spent 4 days in Copenhagen before returning home. Man, Copenhagen was very cool & I could very much see myself living there. I love the bike culture, the sea culture, and the general vibe of the place. Sure, we got some sunny summer days which would skew things. That said, yeah, Copenhagen - would do again.

😷 **Sick as**. The month finished in bed. I'm not sure what I caught, or where I caught it, but I came down with a very nasty virus. Five solid days of 38 degrees C fever kept me in bed, and pretty much knocked me out for over a week. I'm really glad that Kay didn't catch anything.

### Tracking start, stop, continue targets

These are things [I set out to do more or less of in 2024](https://qt.fershad.com/writing/start-stop-continue-2024/). I'm not big on habit tracking, so this "tracking" report is all just vibes.

#### **Start**

- _Going to the gym regularly:_ 😐 Lol, nah. Traveling too much & then sick.
- _Doing 20k+ bike rides each week:_ Nope ❎. But I have put the bike in for maintenance. Hopefully that financial hit will be a forcing function.
- _Writing monthly reviews:_ Yep ⭐, you're reading it now.
- _Taking the cat outside the apartment:_ Nope ❎. She's been very happy we're back home though.
- _Capturing thoughts in a notebook:_ 😐 Didn't do as much as I hoped, especially during our travels.

#### **Stop**

- _Sugary snacks:_ Kinda 😐. I feel like I cut back, even though travel tends to induce a massive sugar craving for me.
- _Using my phone in bed:_ Nope ❎.

#### **Continue**

- _Taking regular breaks/vacations with Kay:_ 😀 We're off again to the Himalayas tomorrow !!
- _Getting nerd-sniped by work stuff:_ Yes 😀. I _still_ want to make a carbon tracking page for my website.
- _Following other folks on RSS:_ Nope ❎. Waaaay behind now. _Still_ gotta clean up my current feed.
- _Building a financial safety-net:_ Nope, lol Norway ... bruh 🙁.
