I'm about to get back into coaching Touch at a local school here in Taipei, and I really liked this quote from Sports Psychologist Dr Scott Goldman from a recent episode of The Bye Round podcast:

> More teams lose games than they do win games. And so it's funny because now there's some literature that's kind of supporting that, which says, hey, go after the people who make the biggest mental errors. Leave the top performers alone. ... And so like the way that I kind of am digesting this literature right now, it is kind of fascinating, instead of trying to raise the ceiling, which is often what you hear from sports, cause like bigger, stronger, faster, let's make, you know, the person who's got the third fastest time in the world, let's help them get the first instead of raising the ceiling. This literature is making the argument, we should be raising the floor.
