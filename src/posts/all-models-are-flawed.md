There's a quote from [George Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong) that I use pretty often in writing and conference talks.

> All models are wrong, some models are useful.

We'll print it on a t-shirt or hoodie someday and sell it as Green Web Foundation merch I'm sure.

I use this quote when talking about the different models and methodologies that are out there for estimating digital carbon emissions. What I'm often at pains to emphasise, though, is that it does not mean _don't use models_ for estimation. Instead, understand that all models have their flaws and shortcomings. It's important to be aware of these when assessing the different estimation models that you can use. In this way, you can be better placed to choose a model that is appropriate for your use case and, in turn, be able to speak more clearly to the results that model gives you.
