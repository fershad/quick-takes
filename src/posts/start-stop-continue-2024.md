I really like [Mike Crittenden's yearly review format](https://critter.blog/2024/01/04/2023-in-review/), and especially the idea of setting out habits/things that you want to start, stop, and continue. This feels like something that would be pretty good for any periodic review be it a performance review at work, a strategy review, or even a personal review like Mike uses it for.

I like the idea so much that I'm going to set out some goals for 2024 in the same format - what do I want to start doing, stop doing, and continue doing?

## Start

- Going to the gym on a regular cadence each week.
- Get back into doing a 20k+ ride (cycle) at least once a week.
- Write monthly reviews, inspired by Dave Rupert's vibe checks.
- Getting the cat comfortable with going outside the apartment.
- Getting ideas/thoughts out of my head and into a notebook.

## Stop

- Reaching for sugary snacks whenever I'm peckish.
- Using my phone in bed.

## Continue

- Taking regular breaks and vacations with Kay.
- Getting nerd-sniped by the stuff I work on with the Green Web Foundation.
- Following other folk's writing through RSS.
- Building up a small safety-net of investments

Let's see how I go with these. I don't plan on keeping a habit journal or anything, so my judgement of how I'm tracking with these things will be based mostly on vibe. Perhaps starting monthly reviews on this site will help me document progress a bit.
