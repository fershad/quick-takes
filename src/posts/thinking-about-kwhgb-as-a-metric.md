The use of kilowatt-hours per gigabyte of data transfer in digital carbon emissions models is something that's been the [source](https://fershad.com/writing/is-data-the-best-proxy-for-website-carbon-emissions/) [of much](https://www.debugbear.com/blog/website-carbon-emissions) [conversation](https://calendar.perfplanet.com/2023/why-web-perf-tools-should-be-reporting-website-carbon-emissions/).

His comment also shares a handy way to think about the metric next time you see it used in an emissions calculation.

> Just quickly about the kWh/GB metric (which is the center of a heated debate in the research community atm): this is a used and useful metric BUT it must be understood as an "attributive" metric (think of it as "how efficiently am I using the network"). It has no "predictive" value (as in "If I send xGB less, I'll consume ykWh less").

> That's completely wrong due to the lack of proportionality I mentioned above.

> The problem is, that (wrong) conclusion is the one that is most intuitive :-/
