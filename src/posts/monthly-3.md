March was a busy one, with lots of travel & connecting.

## March 2024

💚 **Green Web Foundation Team Days**. This year I was again lucky enough to travel to Berlin for a few days and spend time with the amazing group of people I get to call ~~colleagues~~ friends at the Green Web Foundation. We got to sit together in person and look ahead to some of the exciting things we're hoping to shape through our organisation. What's more, we got to sit together and enjoy some fantastic food, drink, and conversation as well ~~

🏉 **Making more Touch friends**. I made this trip to Europe a bit longer so that I could have some time to adjust prior to our team days. That allowed me to get around to a few cities in The Netherlands where some old friends from Taipei now live. I spent time in Amsterdam and Den Haag, before heading to Berlin. In all three cities I got out to play social Touch with the local team. Made some fantastic connections, and I can't wait to see some familiar faces at the World Cup later this year.

🏉 **More Touch, this time in Hong Kong**. As a practice tournament in the lead up to this year's World Cup, I travelled with my local Taiwan Touch club to Hong Kong for their annual international tournament. The trip marked 10 years since our first tour to Hong Kong, and was full of nostalgia as we caught up (and played against) some good friends from around the Asia region. In the end, our team placed third in our division. A solid result, with plenty of takeaways as we prepare for the World Cup in July.

🤖 **Home automation**. I started tinkering with some home automation just before leaving for Berlin. Bad move. Bug caught. I'm mostly looking to automate things around my office at the moment. I've got something working now that adjusts my lights to the right settings for a meeting whenever my webcam is activated. It was cool playing around with things, but not so cool when I got back after three weeks in Europe and forgot how things needed to be configured so they'd work.

### Tracking start, stop, continue targets

These are things [I set out to do more or less of in 2024](https://qt.fershad.com/writing/start-stop-continue-2024/). I'm not big on habit tracking, so this "tracking" report is all just vibes.

#### **Start**

- _Going to the gym regularly:_ Less so this month 😐. Travel really got in the way, though I did run a bit & played a lot of Touch instead.
- _Doing 20k+ bike rides each week:_ Nope ❎. This'll probably be something for later in the year, because World Cup training is taking the priority.
- _Writing monthly reviews:_ Yep ⭐, you're reading it now.
- _Taking the cat outside the apartment:_ Nope ❎. She's just happy I'm back home.
- _Capturing thoughts in a notebook:_ Nope ❎

#### **Stop**

- _Sugary snacks:_ Nope ❎. Too much liquorice in The Netherlands.
- _Using my phone in bed:_ I feel I was better last month ⭐ probably because I was completely exhausted while traveling.

#### **Continue**

- _Taking regular breaks/vacations with Kay:_ Nope ❎. Might see if we can sneak one in during April or May.
- _Getting nerd-sniped by work stuff:_ Nope ❎.
- _Following other folks on RSS:_ Nope ❎. Still gotta clean up my current feed.
- _Building a financial safety-net:_ Nope 🙁.
