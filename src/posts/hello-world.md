Welcome to this new little corner I've created for myself on the internet. This site is a collection of notes and thoughts about different things that catch my interest. It's main purpose is to allow me to get things out of my brain and into the world.

The content of this site will be mostly short-form blog posts. I write longer content [on my personal website](https://www.fershad.com). Some of the notes I leave here will stay as short posts that help capture an idea, thought, or feeling I was having at a particular time. Others might come together to form longer articles which I'll publish on [my blog](https://www.fershad.com/writing/).

Subscribe to the [RSS feed](/feed/feed.xml) to get the latest notes in your reader of choice.
