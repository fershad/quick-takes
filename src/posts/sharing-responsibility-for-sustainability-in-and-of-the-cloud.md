## Sustainability _of_ the cloud

This is remit of the cloud provider/data center operator.

- Optimising cooling efficiency
- Reducing other impacts (water, waste, community)
- Using renewable energy
- Reducing embodied emissions of servers
- Ensuring energy efficient servers

## Sustainability _in_ the cloud

This is the remit of the user provisioning services in the cloud.

- Green region selection
- Optimising utilisation and scaling of resources
- Rightsizing infrastructure
- Implementing efficient data and software design
- Fostering a culture of efficiency

I first came across this model in a [presentation by Catherine Van Loo (Carnstone) at Green Tech Southwest](https://greentechsouthwest.org/insights/dimpact/) in Decemeber, 2023. The above model for shared responsibility of cloud sustainability [comes from ... Amazon Web Services](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/sustainability-pillar/the-shared-responsibility-model.html). So yeah, they've got incentives to shift responsibility onto the user. It kinda has iky _BP telling us to reduce our carbon footprint_ vibes.

Given the size of the major cloud providers, and the amount of cash they have available to [throw at pretty much anything they want](https://rtl.chrisadams.me.uk/2024/01/how-much-power-do-hyperscalers-use-and-how-much-would-it-cost-to-go-24-7/), I'd say the split of this shared responsibility should be biased towards them 70/30 at least.

That's not to say there's nothing users can do to make their cloud utilisation greener, just that the levers they have to pull have a smaller effect than those of the major cloud providers.
