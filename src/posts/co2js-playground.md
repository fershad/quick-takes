  description: As part of an upcoming workshop for the SDIA's Green Coding Summit, I've made an interactive CO2.js playground for people to get hands on with the capabilities of our little JavaScript library.

TL;DR - Play around with the different features of CO2.js in [this interactive Observable notebook](https://observablehq.com/@greenweb/co2-js-playground).

In a couple of weeks, my Green Web Foundation colleague Chris Adams will be running a Green Coding Workshop as part of the [Sustainable Digital Infrastructure Alliance's (SDIA) 2023 Green Coding Summit](https://sdialliance.org/green-coding-summit/2023/). The workshop will focus on providing frontend developers with the knowledge and tools they need to begin measuring the impact of websites and apps.

I'm helping Chris put together the workshop content. It covers carbon estimation models (like [Sustainable Web Design](https://sustainablewebdesign.org/)), the [CO2.js library](https://github.com/thegreenwebfoundation/co2.js) that Chris and I maintain, as well as using tools from [WebPageTest](https://webpagetest.org/) and [Mozilla to measure the impact of a web page](https://fershad.com/writing/co2e-estimates-in-firefox-profiler/).

On cool thing I've been able to spend time making as part of the process has been an Observable notebook showcasing all the different ways CO2.js can be used. It's an interactive way to introduce developers and non-techies to the library and its capabilities. We'll definitely be updating it as a add more APIs, data, and estimation models to the library, but for now you can check it out at [**CO2.js Playground on Observable**](https://observablehq.com/@greenweb/co2-js-playground).

Oh, and if you're in Berlin on November 23 and 24, then grab a ticket for the [SDIA Green Coding Summit](https://sdialliance.org/green-coding-summit/2023/). Our Green Web Foundation workshop will be free for attendees, and there'll also be workshops from our friends at [Boavizta](https://boavizta.org/) and [Green Coding Berlin](https://www.green-coding.org/).
