Life's been coming at me thick and fast this year so I haven't got around to auditing the COP28 website just yet (see my audits of the [COP27](https://fershad.com/writing/cop27-egypt-a-webpage-sustainability-review/) and [COP26](https://fershad.com/writing/cop26-a-quick-sustainability-check/) websites).

Michelle Barker has, however. She's given the site a once over and identified a bunch of problematic practices. Read the post [Greenwashing and the COP28 Website](https://css-irl.info/greenwashing-and-the-cop28-website/).
