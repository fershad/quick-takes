> Progress is impossible without change; and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything.

I came across this quote today from George Bernard Shaw in a post by Jorge Arango titled [Using the Iceberg Model to Understand Complex Situations](https://jarango.com/2023/11/27/using-the-iceberg-model-to-understand-complex-situations/). Boy, did it hit home. I'm in the middle of writing another blog post with pretty much this exact theme, and reading this quote felt very timely. I don't think I'll use it in the post I'm writing currently, but I'm pretty sure it'll feature in a slide deck or article sometime in the not too distant future.
