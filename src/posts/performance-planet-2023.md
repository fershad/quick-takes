I've been wanting to write something for the Web Performance Calendar for years, and finally got around to it! I wrote out some thoughts on the current state of website carbon emissions estimations, and why I believe web performance tools _should_ report on the metric.

I'm very much team "progress over perfection", but whatever your thoughts about the current state of website carbon emission models and tooling, I'd urge you to give this post a read. Even if you remain unconvinced afterwards, I hope it can leave you with some other actionable steps to take so that we can decrease the real world impact of our online presence.
