November was a really, really busy month.

## November 2024

🏉 **Coaching**. For the last couple of years, I've been coaching Touch at a local school during their season (October - January). I do this 3-4 afternoons per week. It means that regular meetings and other work I've got for Green Web Foundation need to be rescheduled. This often results in a few late night calls, and catching up on work over the weekend. Still, I enjoying coaching kids so much and watching their progress through the season - so I'm okay with the other sacrifices.

🕸️ **Grid-aware websites**. November saw us start working in earnest on the Grid-aware Websites project that we've got going at Green Web Foundation. I'm really looking forwards to working on the ideas we plan to explore in the project, and getting my hands messy in some code as well. You can read more about it in this introductory blog post: [https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/news/introducing-our-grid-aware-websites-project/](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/news/introducing-our-grid-aware-websites-project/).

📱 **E-ink Phone**. I bought a Boox Palma 2, e-ink reader this month as well. It's got the form factor of a regular smartphone, and runs Android so regular apps from the Play Store can be installed. I got it with the main idea being that I wanted a (fairly) dumb device that I could use at night before bed to catch up on reading articles & blog posts in Readwise Reader. That part has worked out well, though yes ... I've also installed Bluesky and Mastodon on there as well 😐

### Tracking start, stop, continue targets

These are things [I set out to do more or less of in 2024](https://qt.fershad.com/writing/start-stop-continue-2024/). I'm not big on habit tracking, so this "tracking" report is all just vibes.

#### **Start**

- _Going to the gym regularly:_ 😐 Nah, no time with coaching + work.
- _Doing 20k+ bike rides each week:_ Ditto.
- _Writing monthly reviews:_ Yep ⭐, you're reading it now.
- _Taking the cat outside the apartment:_ Nope ❎. Winter's here, so she wants to just sit on my lap all day.
- _Capturing thoughts in a notebook:_ 😐 No. 2025 ??

#### **Stop**

- _Sugary snacks:_ Yep ⭐. I feel like I'm doing this, without any supporting evidence though.
- _Using my phone in bed:_ Kinda 😀. Boox Palma 2, mentioned above. I still take my phone to bed occasionally, especially if my wife is out late.

#### **Continue**

- _Taking regular breaks/vacations with Kay:_ 😀 We're planning our next trips - Australia in March next year for a family event.
- _Getting nerd-sniped by work stuff:_ Yes 😀. I'm redesigning my site with a bit more dynamic functionality so that it can be used to demo the grid-aware websites work.
- _Following other folks on RSS:_ Nope ❎. But I did nuke my reading list because it was 1000 articles deep & ain't no way I was getting through them.
- _Building a financial safety-net:_ Yes, started to invest a bit more.
